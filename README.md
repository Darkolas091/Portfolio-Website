# Welcome to my Portfolio Website

This portfolio website was created to showcase my work and skills as a developer. It contains a variety of projects I have worked on, as well as my educational and professional background.

On the homepage, you will find an introduction section with a brief description of who I am and what I do. From there, you can navigate to the Projects page, where you can learn more about the projects I have completed. Additionally, the About page provides information on my educational and professional background.

I am always looking to explore new ideas and collaborate with others. If you have any questions or would like to work together on a project, please reach out to me via the Contact page.

Thank you for taking the time to visit my portfolio website. I hope you enjoy your experience.
